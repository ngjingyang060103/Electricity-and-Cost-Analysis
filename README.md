⚡ Electricity Consumption and Cost Analysis
📌 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive data analysis and predictive modelling assignment for the SKE1033 Scientific Programming course.

The goal of this Python script is to analyze household electricity consumption trends across different regions (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) from 2018 to 2022. Beyond simple analysis, the project investigates how real-world factors—specifically household size (number of occupants)—impact energy usage and costs.

📂 Dataset Description
The analysis utilizes a dataset of monthly household electricity records with the following key features:

Timeframe: 2018 – 2022
Regions: Urban, Suburban, Rural
Key Variables:
Consumption_kWh: Monthly energy usage.
Cost_RM: Calculated bill based on a flat rate of RM 0.57 per kWh.
Occupants: Number of people in the household (used as a key correlation factor).
🛠️ Key Features & Methodology
The project follows a structured data science workflow to ensure accuracy and reproducibility.

🧹 Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preparation (Pandas)
Objective: To prepare a reliable dataset by addressing missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.

Handling Missing Values:
Electricity & Cost: Filled using linear interpolation. This technique was selected to preserve time-series trends and seasonal continuity.
Occupant Counts: Imputed using regional medians. This ensured that household structures remained realistic without discarding valuable data rows.
Outlier Management:
Applied the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to detect extreme values.
Outliers were replaced with the median to minimize statistical distortion while maintaining dataset integrity.
🔍 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (NumPy & Pandas)
Objective: To summarize consumption patterns and validate statistical relationships between variables.

Statistical Profiling: Calculated summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) grouped by region to establish baseline usage trends.
Correlation Analysis: Conducted a Pearson correlation analysis to quantify the relationship between household size and electricity usage. This step empirically justified the inclusion of specific features (like occupant count) for the subsequent modelling task.
📊 Task 3: Data Visualization (Matplotlib)
Objective: To uncover underlying trends through visual representation.

Visual Techniques:
Line Graphs: Used to track temporal consumption patterns over the 5-year period.
Multi-line Plots: Demonstrated the consumption disparity between Urban, Suburban, and Rural regions.
Scatter and Box Plots : Visualized the correlation between household size and energy consumption.
💡 Key Analysis Findings
1. Regional Consumption Trends (Time-Series)

📈 Seasonal Patterns:
Peak Usage: Across all regions, consumption consistently spikes in March, April, and May. This correlates with the hottest months, implying heavy reliance on air conditioning.
Troughs: Usage drops to its lowest in September, October, and November, suggesting cooler weather or a transition period with minimal HVAC reliance.
🏙️ Magnitude by Region:
Urban (Green): Highest consumption (450–550 kWh), likely due to high-density living and appliance usage.
Suburban (Orange): Moderate consumption (350–470 kWh).
Rural (Blue): Lowest consumption (250–370 kWh).
Yearly Consistency: Trends are remarkably stable year-over-year, indicating consumption is driven primarily by external factors (seasonality) rather than shifting behavior.
2. The Occupancy Anomaly (Scatter Plot)

📉 Negative Correlation: The scatter plot revealed a counter-intuitive finding: As household size increases, electricity consumption decreases.
2-Person Households: Frequently consume >500 kWh.
7-Person Households: Frequently consume <300 kWh.
Discussion: This suggests a socioeconomic driver. Larger families in this dataset may reside in rural, energy-efficient (or non-AC reliant) homes, while smaller households (singles/couples) likely inhabit high-consumption urban apartments with heavy cooling requirements.
🤖 Task 4: Predictive Modelling (Scikit-Learn)
Objective: To build a Linear Regression model to forecast electricity costs (Cost_RM).

Model Selection: Linear Regression was chosen due to the direct proportional relationship between usage and cost.
Training: Data was split 80:20 for training and testing to ensure unbiased evaluation.
Predictors: Uses Consumption_kWh and Occupants to estimate bills.
📉 Performance Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated using the Coefficient of Determination (
R
2
) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Tight Clustering: The Actual vs. Predicted plot shows predicted points (blue dots) aligning almost perfectly along the 
y
=
x
 red dashed line (Perfect Prediction).
Low Variance: There are minimal outliers. For example, at an actual cost of 200 RM, the model predicts almost exactly 200 RM.
Conclusion: The high linearity between consumption and cost allowed the model to achieve near-perfect predictive accuracy, making it a reliable tool for forecasting electricity bills.
