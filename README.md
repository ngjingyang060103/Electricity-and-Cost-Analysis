Introduction
Electricity sits at the heart of our daily lives. This is because homes fill up with a lot of gadgets and appliances, the way we use power grows more vital and a lot more complicated. Where you live and how many people share your space can change everything. That’s why understanding these patterns matters if we want to manage energy use or keep our bills in check. In this project, we dig into five years’ worth of electricity data from households in cities, suburbs, and rural areas, covering 2018 through 2022. We use Python to break down the trends, track how costs change, and build models that predict what’s next. The big question is, what drives our electricity habits, and how can we make smarter choices?
Objective
In this group project, we explore how households in Urban, Suburban, and Rural areas used electricity and what it cost from 2018 to 2022. First, we clean up and process the data. Then we run some descriptive stats, dig into the patterns with visualizations, and build a model that predicts electricity costs based on how much each home uses and how many people live there. We work in Python, using major data analysis libraries. By the end, we see what really drives household electricity use and learn how these insights help with smarter planning and better cost estimates.
Dataset Description
The dataset used in this study consists of monthly household electricity records collected from 2018 to 2022. Each record includes the year, month, region type (Urban, Suburban, or Rural), monthly electricity consumption measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh), electricity cost calculated at a fixed rate of RM 0.57 per kWh, and the number of occupants living in each household. The inclusion of the occupants variable allows the analysis to reflect real-world household behaviour and enables correlation and predictive analysis between household size, electricity consumption, and cost.
